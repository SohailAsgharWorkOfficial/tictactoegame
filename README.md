## Description
This repository hosts a simple yet engaging Tic Tac Toe game developed using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Tic Tac Toe is a classic game enjoyed by people of all ages, and this project brings it to life in a web-based format.

## Features
- **Interactive Gameplay:** Players can take turns marking their symbols (X or O) on a grid of 3x3 squares until one player achieves a winning pattern or the grid is filled, resulting in a draw.
- **Responsive Design:** The game interface is designed to be responsive, ensuring an optimal experience across various devices and screen sizes.
- **Win Detection:** The game includes logic to detect when a player has achieved a winning pattern (three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal).
- **Turn Indicator:** A visual indicator displays whose turn it is to play, helping players keep track of the game progression.
- **Reset Option:** Players have the option to reset the game at any point, allowing them to start a new match with a clear board.
- **Game Statistics:** Basic statistics such as the number of wins, draws, and total games played can be displayed to track player performance.
- **Accessible Interface:** Efforts have been made to ensure the game is accessible to a wide range of users, including those with disabilities, through features like keyboard navigation and semantic HTML markup.
